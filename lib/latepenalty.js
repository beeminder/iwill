// See the spec for a graph of the credit function and the rationale for this.

/* The main function here is credit(t) which computes the fraction of full 
credit you get for being t seconds late. It's roughly a continuous version of
the following:
  credit(t) = 1      if t<=0s  # not late so no penalty
  credit(t) = .99999 if t<60s  # seconds late (essentially no penalty)
  credit(t) = .999   if t<1h   # minutes late (baaaasically counts)
  credit(t) = .99    if t<1d   # hours late   (no big deal, almost fully counts)
  credit(t) = .9     if t<1w   # days late    (main thing is it's done)
  credit(t) = .5     if t<1mo  # weeks late   (half counts if this late)
  credit(t) = .1     if t<1y   # months late  (mostly doesn't count)
  credit(t) = .01    if t<10y  # years late   (better late than never, barely)
  credit(t) = 0      otherwise # decades late (essentially zero credit)

/* Side note:
An alternative simple late penalty function I've used before in another context 
is 1-(t/(86400*7))^4 which gives you a couple days of very little penalty and
then your credit plummets till you get 0 credit for being more than a week late.
That week can be generalized by replacing the 86400*7 (number of seconds in a
week) in the equation with any amount of time.
