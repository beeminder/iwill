Here are the rules for I-will URLs:

<ol>
<li>Most special characters aren't allowed</li>
<li>Especially don't use hashes &mdash; things break horribly if you do that</li>
<li>And question marks are no good &mdash; things break mildly if you do that</li>
<li>Special paths like /robots.txt are not allowed</li>
</ol>
